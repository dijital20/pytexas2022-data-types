# PyTexas 2022 Talk Slides: Choosing the Right Data Type

If you're here, hopefully, you saw my talk at PyTexas 2022, "Choosing the Right Data Type".

Slides are available in [Slides.md](Slides.md). These are done using [Marp](https://marpit.marp.app/). The team there 
has a [wonderful extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode) 
for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that provides a preview for Marp markdown slides.

There's also a cheat sheet available in [Cheatsheet.md](Cheatsheet.md). This contains more examples than I could cram 
into the slides and summarizes the content from the presentation in a simple reference form.

Post-conference Josh here! These links came up during discussions I had during the conference, which had nothing to do with the topic. I refer to these sites/books now and then, and I feel like, are worth reading:
