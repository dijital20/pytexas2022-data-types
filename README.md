# PyTexas 2022 Talk Slides: Choosing the Right Data Type

If you're here, hopefully, you saw my talk at PyTexas 2022, "Choosing the Right Data Type".

Slides are available in [Notes.md](Notes.md). These are done using [Marp](https://marpit.marp.app/). The team there 
has a [wonderful extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode) 
for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that provides a preview for Marp markdown slides.

There's also a cheat sheet available in [Cheatsheet.md](Cheatsheet.md). This contains more examples than I could cram 
into the slides and summarizes the content from the presentation in a simple reference form.
